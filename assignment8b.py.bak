# The list,numb,contains integers.write code that populates the listremainder with the remainder of 
# 36 divide by each numb.for eg. the element should be 0, because 36/6 has no remainder. If there is an error, 
# have the string "error" appear in the remainder

numb=[6, 0, 36, 8, 2, 36, 0, 12, 60, 0, 45, 0, 3, 23]
